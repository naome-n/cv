      <li><strong>Spring 2019 Research Proposal on Modeled Pharmacokinetics of a Contrast Agent in Patients with Anemia</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Proposes to expand the SDE model made by Susanne Ditlevsen and Adeline Samson to include patients who suffer from anemia in which they have a significantly lower hematocrit level.</li>
        <li>Explore how the contrast agent concentration would change along time if the arteries are blocked or damaged</li>
        <li>Analyze how the pharmacokinetic model would change with different assumptions, using the stochastic approach to account for random fluctuations</li>
      </ul>
      <li><strong>Spring 2018 Research Project How Cosmetics with Microbeads Affect Water Quality</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Hypothesis: When cosmetic microbeads are drained into the water, it lowers the water quality index of the water.</li>
        <li>Analyzed the total phosphates, dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, and colony forming units (CFU) of all our control and experimental groups and reported data using descriptive and inferential statistics.</li>
      </ul>
